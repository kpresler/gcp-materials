# EN.500.113 (Gateway Python) Materials

This repository contains Dr. Kai's materials for Gateway Python at Johns Hopkins.

This repository will be fleshed out with additional materials as we progress through the semester; I'll have our sample code and execises uploaded before class, and sample solutions to the exercises uploaded somewhat after class.
